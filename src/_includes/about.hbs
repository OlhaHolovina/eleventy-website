  <h1>About Burlington, ON</h1>
  <h3>Location</h3>
    <p>The City of Burlington is nestled between two amazing geographical features – the Niagara Escarpment and the shores of Lake Ontario – Burlington’s total land area is 187 sq. km</p>
    <p>The city center is located primarily in the southern part of the city of Burlington, while its agricultural, rural residences, several golf courses and conservation areas are in the northern limits. This makes the city an ideal place to cycle up the foothills of the escarpment or along the waterfront, hike the Bruce Trail, or practice water sports during the summer months.</p>
  <h3>Climate</h3>
  <p>Generally, temperatures are warmer and humid during the summer and cooler damp in the winter. Located on the western coast of Lake Ontario, the city enjoys wonderful spring and summer weather. Burlington also benefits from the sheltering effects of the Niagara Escarpment creating the most spectacular canopies of fall colours in October. Spring blossoms are something to behold, and they are generally popping out from mid-April to early June.</p>
  <h3>Community & Lifestyle</h3>
  <p>Burlington boasts some of the best hiking area in the world as it's home to the <strong>Bruce Trail</strong> and the <strong>Niagara Escarpment</strong>, a UNESCO-designated World Biosphere Reserve. The Waterfront Trail – part of the Niagara-on-the-Lake to Québec border trail – along with Spencer Smith Park gives you a front-row seat to panoramic views of Lake Ontario. </p>
  <p>Burlington is dedicated to the United Nations philosophy of peaceful co-operation among the peoples of the world. It encourages community understanding of different cultures and global issues. Many ongoing community-based projects and events strengthen these ties.</p>
